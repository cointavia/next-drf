# **Next-DRF: The Ultimate Full-Stack Framework**

üöÄ **Next-DRF** is a developer-friendly, highly scalable full-stack framework combining the power of **Next.js** for the frontend and **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** for the backend. Designed for simplicity and flexibility, it enables developers to build robust applications effortlessly while supporting modern best practices like Tailwind CSS for styling and seamless authentication integrations.

---

## **Why Next-DRF?**

1. **Seamless Full-Stack Development**: Combines the best of React and Django under one roof.
2. **Flexibility**: Offers multiple authentication providers like AWS Cognito, Firebase, Auth0, Okta, and custom implementations.
3. **Preconfigured Setup**: Get started with built-in routing, Tailwind CSS, and API integrations out of the box.
4. **Developer-Centric**: Supports environment-based configurations, secure API key management, and auto-migration commands.
5. **Scalable**: Ready for microservices, multi-database support, and modern deployment strategies.

---

## **Features**

- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js 15** using both App Router and Page Router for flexibility.
- **Backend**: Powered by **Django Rest Framework** with pre-configured user authentication and APIs.
- **Styling**: Pre-integrated with **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and responsive UI development.
- **Authentication**: Support for multiple authentication providers:
  - AWS Cognito
  - Firebase
  - Auth0
  - Okta
  - Custom User Authentication
- **CLI Tools**: Simplifies project setup and management with commands like `npx next-drf-cli`.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Ideal for modern full-stack and microservice-based applications.

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

#### Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Database Migrations
Run migrations to set up the database:
